# atmega-codes

A companion repository for IoT part in TEQIP Workshop.

## Hardware Used
eYFi-Mega

## Resources
1. `uart_rpc` - The most useful code in this repository is `uart_rpc`. Its a superset of `UART_RX` which Vikrant had written. 
The sensors and actuators are interfaced with Atmega side of eYFi-Mega but the controlling is done 
from [ESP side](https://github.com/eyantra-iot-platform/embedded-systems-iot-w-mos/tree/master/uart_rpc).
2. `solenoid_valve_intefacing`
3. `rgb_led`, `rgb_port_init_mos`
